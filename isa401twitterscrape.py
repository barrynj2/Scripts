"""
Objective: This file is intended to use Python to Import Datasets from Twitter.
 This File Works Better on Python(x,y). If you are an IDLE user, please comment
 the OS clearing steps. Thank you

Instructions:
-------------
A] In order for this file to work correctly, make sure that you have 
   installed the Tweepy Library (see https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
   The re, time and OS libraries should be already installed on your computer.
   

B] Go to http://dev.twitter.com and create an app. 
   The consumer key and secret will be generated for you after
   After the step above, you will be redirected to your app's page.
   Create an access token under the the [Your access token] section
   For additional details on authentication, see:
   http://pythonhosted.org/tweepy/html/auth_tutorial.html#auth-tutorial


Credits:
--------
The Printing of the Twitter Stream to the Console is based on code originally 
written by Prof. Justin Yates, Texas A&M and edited by Jason Olson and Chase
Murray, University at Buffalo. Jason's code was designed to store the tweet's 
(text, created_at, id, and setTerms) in a text file. Our code stores additional
variables (e.g. coordinates of the tweet) which into an excel file. We parse 
all important fields in the Excel file to reduce the amount of post processing
needed for analysis.


How the Search Terms Were Selected:
----------------------------------
Search Terms for the Superobowl Ads were decided based on these websites:
   a] http://goo.gl/HaF74M
   b] http://goo.gl/wikEIl
   c] http://goo.gl/FDzuJD
